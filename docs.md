## goals

i am making this languages as a personal project in an attempt to change the way i think  
this language should force the user to be explicitly aware of the connections between the words said, piritcularly cause and effect  
i intend this language for personal use, primarily with thinking, secondly with writing and speaking  
the language should be as simple as is reasonable  
the language should sound good  

## phonology

consonants
| |labial|alveolar|palatal|glottal|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|nasal|m|n| | |
|plosive|b|d| |x\*|
|fricative|v|s\*/z|j|h|
|approximant| |l/r|y| |

vowels
| |front|central|back|
|---|---|---|---|
|close|i| |u|
|open-mid|e| |o|
|open| |a| |

dipthongs can be created between any vowels in the table  

used letters: abdehijmnorsuvxyz  
unused letters: cfgkpqtw  
\*s and x can not be used in normal words  

## morphology

all words are root words  

all words are one syllable  

syllables are either CV, CVV, CCV, or CCVV  

## grammer

### clauses

all words in a clause are either a head or dependant  
heads are either causes or effects  

a **head** is a fundemental thing the clause is talking about  
    heads are unmarked  

a **dependant** is a modifier of the head it is attached to  
    dependants follow the head they are attached to  
    dependants are marked with a "s" before the word  
    dependants of dependant are marked with additional "s"es for each degree of seperation from the head  

the **cause** is the head that acts on the following heads  
    the cause is always the first word in the clause  

a **effect** is acted on by the preceding heads, and acts on the following heads  

there must be some causal relationship between the heads in a clause, else you move to a new clause  

## borrowing

some words are created for their contrast with other words, with english not being considered  
some words are created considering english equivilants, and may be borrowed from an english word  
all borrowed words are CCVV

the prosess by which words get borrowed is as such  

1. assimilation
    - consonant assimilation does not consider sounds, only letters
    - start -> end, unchanged letters not shown
    - c -> y
    - f -> v
    - g -> y
    - k -> y
    - p -> b
    - q -> y
    - s -> z
    - t -> d
    - w -> v
    - x -> z
    - vowel assimiltion does not consider letters, only sounds
    - conlang : english 
    - i : front close
    - e : front mid
    - a : front open, central open, back open
    - u : central close, back close
    - o : central mid, back mid
2. the first vowel is the start of the dipthong V
3. the second vowel is the end of the dipthong, if there is not one, then 'a' is used
3. the consonant before the first vowel is the C before the dipthong
    - if there is no consonant before, then check backwards from the end of the word
4. the consonant before the first consonant is the second C
    - if there is no consonant before, then check backwards from the end of the word
