## goals

this language is ment for personal use, primarily for thinking, secondly for writing and speaking  
this language should force the user to be explicitly aware of the relationship between concepts, piritcularly cause and effect  
this language should be as simple as is reasonable  
this language should sound good  

## phonology

consonants
| |labial|alveolar|palatal|glottal|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|nasal|m|n| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|plosive|b|d| |x\*|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|fricative|v|s\*/z|j|h|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|approximant| |l/r|y| |

vowels
| |front|central|back|
|---|---|---|---|
|close|i| |u|
|---|---|---|---|
|open-mid|e| |o|
|---|---|---|---|
|open| |a| |

dipthongs can be created between any vowels in the table  

used letters: abdehijmnorsuvxyz  
unused letters: cfgkpqtw  
\*s and x can not be used in normal words  

## syntax

syllables are either CV, CVV, CCV, or CCVV  

VV is a dipthong  

## grammer

### clauses

all words in a clause are either a head or dependant  
heads are either causes or effects  

a **head** is a fundemental thing the clause is talking about  
    heads are unmarked  

a **dependant** is a modifier of the head it is attached to  
    dependants follow the head they are attached to  
    dependants are marked with a "s" before the word  
    dependants of dependant are marked with additional "s"es for each degree of seperation from the head  

the **cause** is the head that acts on the following heads  
    the cause is always the first word in the clause  

a **effect** is acted on by the preceding heads, and acts on the following heads  

there must be some causal relationship between the heads in a clause, else you move to a new clause  

## borrowing

some words are created for their contrast with other words, with english not being considered  
some words are created considering english equivilants, and may be borrowed from an english word  

the prosess by which words get borrowed is as such  

1. assimilation
    - consonant assimilation does not consider sounds, only letters
    - start -> end
    - m -> m
    - p -> p
    - b -> b
    - w -> w
    - n -> n
    - t -> t
    - d -> d
    - s -> _
    - r -> r
    - l -> l
    - y -> y
    - k -> k
    - g -> g
    - c -> k
    - f -> w
    - h -> y
    - j -> r
    - q -> k
    - v -> w
    - x -> _
    - z -> _
    - vowel assimiltion does not consider letters, only sounds
    - conlang : english 
    - i : front close
    - e : front mid
    - a : front open, central mid, central open, back open
    - u : central close, back close
    - o : back mid
2. the first vowel is the V in a CVC
3. the consonant before the first vowel is the first C
    - if there is no consonant before, then check backwards from the end of the word
4. the consonant after the first vowel is the second C
