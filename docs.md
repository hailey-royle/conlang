# conlang docs

*this documentation is in a very crude state and only ment to be usefull to me, others be warned*  

## goals

i am making this language as a personal project in an attempt to change the way i think  
the language should force the user to be explicitly aware of the connections between the words said, pirticularly cause and effect  
i intend this language for personal use, primarily with thinking, secondly with writing and speaking  
the language should be as simple as is reasonable  
the language should sound good  

## phonology

consonants
| |labial|alveolar|palatal|glottal|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|nasal|m|n| | |
|plosive|b|d| | |
|fricative|v|s\* / z|x\* / j|h|
|approximant| |l / r|y| |

vowels
| |front|central|back|
|---|---|---|---|
|close|i| |u|
|open-mid|e| |o|
|open| |a| |

dipthongs can be created between any vowels in the table  

used letters: abdehijmnorsuvxyz  
unused letters: cfgkpqtw  
\*s and x can not be used in normal words  

## morphology

all words are root words  

all words are one syllable  

syllables are either CV, CVV, CCV, or CCVV  

## semantics

all words are a refrence to an abstract concept, and only a refrence to an abstract concept  

any degree of specificity is relegated to context or other words  

## syntax

there is no gramatical catagory  
word order and operators give structure to a sentance  

the most important word in a sentance is the **head**, it is what the sentance is about  
the head is always the first word  
all other words add information about the head  

the rest of the words in a sentance can either be a **specifier** or **corollary**  

corollarys give information about the effects of the head or other corollarys  

specifiers add more information about the word it is modifying  

### marking

for specifiers of the word directly before it, there is no marking 
for specifiers of the word two before, a "s" is added to the begining of the word, adding another s each additional place back  
for corollarys, a "x" is added to the begining, adding another x each additional place back  

## borrowing

some words are created for their contrast with other words, with english not being considered  
some words are created considering english equivilants, and may be borrowed from an english word  
all borrowed words are CCVV

the prosess by which words get borrowed is as such  

1. assimilation
    - consonant assimilation does not consider sounds, only letters
    - start -> end, unchanged letters not shown
    - c -> y
    - f -> v
    - g -> y
    - k -> y
    - p -> b
    - q -> y
    - s -> z
    - t -> d
    - w -> v
    - x -> z
    - vowel assimiltion does not consider letters, only sounds
    - conlang : english 
    - i : front close
    - e : front mid
    - a : front open, central open, back open
    - u : central close, back close
    - o : central mid, back mid
2. the first vowel is the start of the dipthong V
3. the second vowel is the end of the dipthong, if there is not one, then 'a' is used
3. the consonant before the first vowel is the C before the dipthong
    - if there is no consonant before, then check backwards from the end of the word
4. the consonant before the first consonant is the second C
    - if there is no consonant before, then check backwards from the end of the word
