# conlang docs

*this documentation is in a very crude state and only ment to be usefull to me, others be warned*  

## goals

i am making this language as a personal project in an attempt to change the way i think  
the language should force the user to be explicitly aware of the connections between the words said, pirticularly cause and effect  
i intend this language for personal use, primarily with thinking, secondly with writing and speaking  
the language should be as simple as is reasonable  
the language should sound good

## morphology

all words are root words  

all words are one syllable and a trailing vowel ( CVC V )  

## semantics

all words are a refrence to an abstract concept  
all further specficity is expresed through context or other words  

## syntax

there is no gramatical catagory  
word order and trailing vowel inflection give structrue to words  

a sentance is constructed by adding information to the **origin**  
following words can either be a **corrilary** or a **specifier**  

**origin** - the first head in a sentance, always the first word  

**corrilary** - all heads following the first head  

**head** - the first word in a clause, does not add any spcification to any other word

**depandant head** - a head which is an effect of the first caluses, head.

**specifier** - a word which provides more information about a head

**clause** - a head, optional followed by a number of specifiers

**sentance** - a clause, optionaly followed by a number of depantant heads

in a clause, you can also go back and add more context about a previously mentioned word
by marking the end of the specifier string then repeating the word you want to add context to

### marking  

the marking of the vowel signifies the end of something
word marking is found in the trailing vowel, which can either be;

unmarked - normal vowel
the end of the specifier string - clipped - abrupt end
the end of the clause - lengtheded - vowel pronounced for longer
the end of the sentance - dipthonged shwa - added shwa at the end

## borrowing

some words are created for their contrast with other words, with english not being considered  
some words are created considering english equivilants, and may be borrowed from an english word  
all borrowed words are CCVV

the prosess by which words get borrowed is as such  

1. assimilation
    - consonant assimilation does not consider sounds, only letters
    - start -> end, unchanged letters not shown
    - c -> y
    - f -> v
    - g -> y
    - k -> y
    - p -> b
    - q -> y
    - s -> z
    - t -> d
    - w -> v
    - x -> z
    - vowel assimiltion does not consider letters, only sounds
    - conlang : english 
    - i : front close
    - e : front mid
    - a : front open, central open, back open
    - u : central close, back close
    - o : central mid, back mid
2. the first vowel is the start of the dipthong V
3. the second vowel is the end of the dipthong, if there is not one, then 'a' is used
3. the consonant before the first vowel is the C before the dipthong
    - if there is no consonant before, then check backwards from the end of the word
4. the consonant before the first consonant is the second C
    - if there is no consonant before, then check backwards from the end of the word
