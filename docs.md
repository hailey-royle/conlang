## grammer

words are either CV or CVC  

*11/5 this structure means that the maximum number of words is 780*  
*i do not think this will be enough, but do not know how i will fix this*  

### clauses

all words in a clause are either a head or dependant  
heads are either causes or effects  

a **head** is a fundemental thing the clause is talking about  
    heads are unmarked  

a **dependant** is a modifier of the head it is attached to  
    dependants follow the head they are attached to  
    dependants are marked with a "s" before the word  
    dependants of dependant are marked with additional "s"es for each degree of seperation from the head  

the **cause** is the head that acts on the following heads  
    the cause is always the first word in the clause  

a **effect** is acted on by the preceding heads, and acts on the following heads  

there must be some causal relationship between the heads in a clause, else you move to a new clause
