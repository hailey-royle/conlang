## Translating Ode To Aphrodite into dzou dyoa ma  

> Ornate-throned immortal Aphrodite, wile-weaving  
> daughter of Zeus, I entreat you: do not overpower my  
> heart, mistress, with ache and anguish,  
> but come here, if ever in the past you heard my voice  
> from afar and acquiesced and came, leaving your  
> father’s golden house,  
> with chariot yoked: beautiful swift sparrows whirring  
> fast-beating wings brought you above the dark earth  
> down from heaven through the mid-air,  
> and soon they arrived; and you, blessed one, with a  
> smile on your immortal face asked what was the matter  
> with me this time and why I was calling this time  
> and what in my maddened heart I most wished to  
> happen for myself: “Whom am I to persuade this time to  
> lead you back to her love? Who wrongs you, Sappho?  
> If she runs away, soon she shall pursue; if she does not  
> accept gifts, why, she shall give them instead; and if she  
> does not love, soon she shall love even against her will.”  
> Come to me now again and deliver me from oppressive  
> anxieties; fulfil all that my heart longs to fulfil, and you  
> yourself be my fellow-fighter.  
> — Sappho  
> (6th century BCE)
